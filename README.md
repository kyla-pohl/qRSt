This document presents my implementation of the generalized version of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm as described by Aigner and Frieden in their [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13846) $q$RS$t$: A probabilistic Robinsonâ€“Schensted correspondence for Macdonald polynomials. The implementation is provided in a Jupyter notebook with a Sage kernel.
