This document presents my implementation of the generalized version of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm as described by Aigner and Frieden in their paper [$q$RS$t$: A probabilistic Robinsonâ€“Schensted correspondence for Macdonald polynomials](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13846). The implementation is provided in a Jupyter notebook with a Sage kernel.
