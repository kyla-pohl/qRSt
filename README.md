# qRSt
This is my implementation of a generalized version of the Robinson-Schensted algorithm as described by Aigner and Frieden in their paper [qRSt: A probabilistic Robinsonâ€“Schensted correspondence for Macdonald polynomials](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.13846). The implementation is provided in a Jupyter notebook with a Sage kernel.
